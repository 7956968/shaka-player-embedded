# This is not run normally, this should only be run manually when updating the
# curl version.  This runs configure with the correct settings so the developer
# can update the BUILD.gn file appropriately.

# This script will also create the curl_config.h file.  That file should be
# manually modified and copied to //third_party/curl/config/*/.
# The file will need to be modified for our custom BoringSSL build:
# - BoringSSL doesn't have ENGINE_cleanup.
# - BoringSSL doesn't have ENGINE_load_builtin_engines.
# - BoringSSL doesn't have the <openssl/engine.h> file.
